## 🎯 **Result**

Your store will now show **ONLY** the apps/games/files that you have uploaded through the admin panel:

- ✅ **No more fake/demo apps**
- ✅ **Only your real uploaded content**
- ✅ **Clean, authentic store experience**
- ✅ **No pseudo content cluttering the interface**

## 📋 **What Shows Now**

1. **For You Section**: Only your uploaded files
2. **Games Section**: Only uploaded .apk/.game files you added
3. **Apps Section**: Only uploaded .exe/.msi/.app files you added
4. **Websites Section**: Only uploaded website files you added

## 🚀 **How to Apply Database Cleanup (Optional)**

If you want to also remove any demo data that might be in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://bfnbgcezsxakhgkkmdqq.supabase.co
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `CLEAN_DEMO_DATA.sql`
4. Run the migration to clean up demo data

## 🔍 **Testing**

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. You should now see only the files you actually uploaded
3. If you haven't uploaded any files yet, the store will be empty (which is correct!)
4. Use the admin panel to upload your first real app/game

The store is now clean and shows only authentic content that you've uploaded! 🎉
