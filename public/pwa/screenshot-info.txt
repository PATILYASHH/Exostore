<!-- PWA Screenshot Placeholder -->
<!-- This would be replaced with actual screenshots in production -->

For PWA screenshots, you need:
1. Desktop screenshot: 1280x720 pixels (wide form factor)
2. Mobile screenshot: 390x844 pixels (narrow form factor)

These should show your app's main interface and help users understand what they'll see when they install your PWA.
